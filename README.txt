Hi!

This is a repository for simulation code for the paper "Suppressing cascades of load on interdependent networks" by C. D. Brummitt, R. M. D'Souza, E. A. Leicht (2011)

The simulation code is written in Python. Code for plotting the results were done in Mathematica (which may be uploaded to Github, too, but are available on request).
